        Once transistors settled in there were still many advances to be made which brought them to where they are today. One of the first major changes that wasn’t from Bell Labs was made by Texas Instruments. In 1954 Gordon Teal announced that TI was starting production on three new types of silicon transistors which he then displayed to the audience how the new transistors worked at far higher temperature and in oil.

        With the rapid rise in transistors manufactures were looking for better ways to mass produce circuits. Alone working late at TI one-night at Jack Kilby realized that if an entire circuit was made from a single material it could be created in a single step, after bringing the idea to his boss he was assigned on it. In September 1958 TI filed a patent for the Hybrid IC, however at Sherman Fairchild Robert Noyce had a similar idea and filed a patent for Unitary circuits just 4 months later while TI’s patent was being reviewed. Noyce’s idea was made of silicon and was more practical from Kilby’s idea.

        Numerous more additions, changes, and new transistors have been made since then allowing for the prices to continue to drop while power increases. Today transistors are in nearly all electric devices and created the modern world in the way it is allowing for many devices to be powered cheaply and still have them do calculations which are far more advanced then could have ever been done manually. Roughly 13 sextillion MOSFETs have been manufactured which are the most common modern transistor.
