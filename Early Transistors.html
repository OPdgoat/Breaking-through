      <p>
        The first two people who worked towards solid state information transfer were Julius Lilienfeld and Oskar Heil. Lilienfeld produced two patents relating to transistors, the more famous one talks about a three-electrode structure on a copper semiconductor. This device is close to a modern field effect transistor, however there is no documentation of it ever being produced or used. Oskar Heil studied silicon crystals in an attempt to increase purity, but a cracked crystal had an odd behavior where the current flowing through changed over water and over a hot soldering iron. This was due to each side of the crystal containing different purities and was used as the first P-N Junction.

        The majority of early pioneering efforts in transistors happened at the famous Bell Labs. In the span of a single month John Bardeen and Walter Brattain managed to work together and produce the first point-contact transistor. The original prototype was made from silicon, but it was discovered that germanium greatly increased amplification. Over the next few years Bell Labâ€™s scientists and engineers continued to investigate and innovate.
