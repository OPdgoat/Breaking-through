        The very first radios in the 1890’s were impractical with the amplification producing only strong radio waves. The waves would dissipate with distance and through objects quickly. This problem was fixed quickly with the vacuum tube which improved amplification of signals. However, vacuum tubes had numerous problems, they consumed vast amounts of energy, were expensive, limited in quantity of information, and burned out quickly.

        The first major advance in vacuum tubes was made by Lee de Forest who created the most famous design, the triode. By adding a third electrode in the form of a control grid the triode could send long-distance information.

        Machines built with vacuum tubes were giant and compared to today standards had very little computing power. This prompted some people to begin looking towards alternatives.
